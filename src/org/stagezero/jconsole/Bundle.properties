OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    This is a general purpose system console app built primarily so I wouldn't have to leave Netbeans in order to play with Ruby on Rails (RoR) on the Windows platform.\n\n\
    JConsole can be used as an embedded or standalone command prompt (e.g. cmd.exe)\n\nIt simply forks a system process via ProcessBuilder and handles I/O via SwingWorker without using or starting any additional threads. \
    It can also be extended to use other shells (e.g. \
    /bin/bash).\n\n\
    Enjoy!!! \
