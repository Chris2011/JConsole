OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    This is a general-purpose system console app built primarily so I wouldn't have to leave Netbeans in order to \nplay with NodeJS, Ruby on Rails (RoR) and the Play Framework while on the Windows platform.\n\n\
    JConsole is very light-weight and can be easily embedded into any app.\n\n\
    It can also be used as a standalone system shell or command prompt (e.g. cmd.exe) for running scripts, code \ngenerators and/or other system/development utilities.\n\n\
    How does it work?\n\
    ---------------------\nJConsole simply forks a system process via <ProcessBuilder> and handles I/O via a <SwingWorker> without \nusing or spawning any additional background threads.\n\n\
    It does not depend on any external libraries or 3rd party packages and can be extended to use other shells \nbesides cmd.exe (e.g. \
    /bin/bash).\n\n\
    Enjoy!!! \
