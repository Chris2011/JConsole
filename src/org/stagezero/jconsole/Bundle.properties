OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    This is a general purpose system console app using SwingWorker and ProcessBuilder\n built primarily so I wouldn't have to leave Netbeans in orderto play with Rails on the\n Windows platform.\n\n\
    JConsole simply forks a system process via ProcessBuilder and handles IO via SwingWorker \nwithout using or starting any additional threads. \n\n\
    It can be tweaked for OSX and Linux.  \
    Enjoy!!! \
